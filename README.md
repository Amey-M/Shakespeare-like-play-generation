# Shakespeare-like-play-generation
This is the code used to perform generate a simple shakespeare-like play using just an LSTM layer.
I have used only 1 LSTM layer due to hardware restrictions but the model can definately be improved upon using more advanced techniques/Libraries such as BERT, NLTK etc.
It should mainly be seen as a sort of basic example of what NLP is like and to show that we can generate really awesome stuff even with basic techniques like tokenization and vectorization.
